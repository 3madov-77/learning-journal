* Computers helps us in the thinking way we are (raising stars, moving trains, OR even sloving you Homework..) infact computer uses un counted at all!! perfect machin that bult with sircts

# Computers History:
the first compuer in the world was bult with wood and mewtal mechanical gears till the 20th century were the computers starts to use the elctroinc components, it was realy big and large!!(it taking big room), the point was to make an clucatore..



## The Computer biscly uses the **'ISPO'** *(Input, Storage, Processing, Output)* teqniuqes:

# 1. Inputs :
the part witch tell computer what to do EX:(mouse, keybord, camera), witch give computers information that stores it in storage then let it ready for **Procsesing**

# 2. Procsesing :
it takes the data from the storag works depinding on algorthems was seted befour then sends it back to storage agian as information, this countinue until the iformations are ready to **output**..

# 3. Outputs :
witch hapening with screens or spekers or even send to be *other computer input* throgh internet..

- ## Inside the computers:
basicly it has alot of electric sercits and wires that cary all information on the computer, cuse it depends on the elctristy in if it **on** or **off** and thats what called the binary number system **1 or 0** (witch can use to count for any number..also you can change any text for number then re presnt it by binary sys!) SO .. more wires you have = more numbers you can stores..

> Why smale computers are very fast!?
simply smale computers mean it made with small circts **and** small sircuts mean small distny for electricy to move on..

- ## how the sowftware works :
the sowftware is bunsh of coomands to do things same as (functions aidea) it writen with codes that convert it basicly to millons of small **binary** commands that sent to CPU to Procsesing then computer understand it..but when you need to use alot of sowftwares in same time you will need something to orgnize it..and thats what **Operating systeams** do

## What is OS :
it is the master program with special abilities that manges how software uses the hardware of computer it helos you to install new programes by loding them inside your pc..

> "Computers have potential to do all amzing thigs, but the only thing witch makes computers smart or useful is **you** when you learn to code you get yo define the problem you want to slove, and write software that turns those ideas into reality, that give you the power to build things that mater to you, your comunity, and the world.."
