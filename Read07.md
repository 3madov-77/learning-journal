# What JS allows you to do :
it allows you to make webpages more interactive by:
1. access content: actuly js allows you to select any element, attrbute, or text from an HTML page
2. modify the content: also it allows you to modify any element, attrbute, or text from an HTML page
3. program rules: that JS alows you to specify a set of steps that the browser will follow it
4. react to events: also JS alows you to specify when the script should run, like when specific event hapend..

and there is many examples of JS in internet like (SLIDESHOWS, FORMS, RELOAD PART OF PAGE, FILTERING DATA)

# what is the script and how do i creat one:
 - the ***script*** is: a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal its like(RECIPES. or HAND BOOKS, or even MANUALS)
 - first of all you need to state your goal like in HTML you can also sketch what you want to do.. like its will be very useful to start drowing what you think the script will be about like (the big idea) then you can:
1. **DEFINE** it to small goals
2. **DESIGN** the the small goals, then you can write down the steps witch should coputer folow
3. **CODE** each step you write it down

and here it comes the time to use the Vocabulary and the Syntax
> You need to learn to "think" like a computer so you can let it to understand you

# What EXPRESSIONS is :
an evaluates into (results in) a single value, and there are two types of:
- THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE (witch the var will be 1 specifc value)
- THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE (when it could be math maybe)

# What OPERATORS is :
it is things relayed to exprissions that they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values and there is many taypes of like :

## the mathematical operators in JS :
which you can use with numbers, You may remember some from math class..

> remeber that is there is performed mathmatical than others (same in math)

# FUNCTIONS :
simply its bunsh of steps that work step by step to achive goal, and its reusable

## How to creat a Function :
first of all you need to start by calling `function`, then give it a name after space like `function sleep()` *follwd with prentheses, and finly we add the curly braces `function sleep(){}` and betwin them will have the task like `function sleep(){document.write('Heloo world')};`

## Calling a Function :
after creating the function it will stay there wating for call to start, and this happen with only 1 line! by caling the function name folowed with parantheses like: `sleep();`, after excuting the function it will countinue the code at the after the same calling line...

### Function witch need information:
sometimes the function needs specafic information to use in and it will be inside the paranthases acting like varubles only inside the function.. like: `function pluse(x, y){}`, and we must let th last step of the function in this case is to return the varubles like: `function pluse(x, y){(the steps); return x + y}`
and when we call that kind of functions we must to mention the informations value inside the paranthses like: `pluse(5, 6)`
