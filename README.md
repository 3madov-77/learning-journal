# Who am i :

 Im a student in LTUC cooding course my name is Emad alzoubi (3madov as many of you know me)
im aiming to be a sowftware engenier in the future (inSha2Alah), but its so hard to reach real success if you cant set your mind to think in right way, its so depressed to try alot and alot with no consequences(emoji).. but laitly i just descovird that is my thinkig way is horrbly wrong!
to let you understand what im talking about..there is 2 kinds of thinkig the fixed one and the Growth one well i know it seems Complex to you what is what im tlking about but just stay with me..have you ever seen someone that sccessed in something that you traying to gain it!!?? maybe you will think 'its hard felling.... will maybe it is but the harder will be if you just keep stuk in the same place!!
so to avoid that you can just take his success as inspire to you in your exprince..will i belive that any successed person will love to share how he get there and you can learn from!! (now you are in my side) well this is one of Growth mindset features and there is more taill you get to the real success!!
and here i will show you the way to how become a good growth mindset witch will helps you to achive more like me in realy small time
witch is:

- [x] ***improve my typing skils***
- [x] ***Finish my courses very well***
- [x] ***learn more about Web Devolpment***
- [x] ***improve my English languge***
- [x] ***growing in my work and life***

>## Its hard to be success, But its not imposible. 
so the `steps` is:

### 2. Challenges:
***W***

>### 1. being Respectable:
***R***espect the other and how they think `thats not meaning to agree them at all..`
 but we have to respect the way they think who ever they are..
