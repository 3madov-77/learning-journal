# Evaluating Conditions in opreators:
so simply it mean comparing a Value to other in the script..
the result will be onr of tow (True OR False)

- ### Is Equal To :

witch compares tow values to see if they are the same

- ### Strict Equal to :
![cap](https://3madov-77.github.io/learning-journal/New%20folder/Capture-8-2a.PNG)

witch used to compare two values to cheak that both the data type are same

- ### Is Not Equal To :
![cap](https://3madov-77.github.io/learning-journal/New%20folder/Capture-8-3a.PNG)

witch compares tow values to see if they are the ***Not*** the same

- ### Strict Not Equal To :
![cap](https://3madov-77.github.io/learning-journal/New%20folder/Capture-8-4a.PNG)

witch used to compare two values to cheak that both the data type are ***Not*** the same

- ### Greater Than :
![cap](https://3madov-77.github.io/learning-journal/New%20folder/Capture-8-5a.PNG)

witch cheaks if the numbers on the left is greater than the numbers in the right

- ### Greater Than Or Equal To :
![cap](https://3madov-77.github.io/learning-journal/New%20folder/Capture-8-6a.PNG)

witch cheaks if the numbers on the left is greater or equal the numbers in the right

- ### Less Than :
![cap](https://3madov-77.github.io/learning-journal/New%20folder/Capture-8-7a.PNG)

witch cheaks if the numbers on the left is less than the numbers in the right

- ### Less Than Or Equal To :

witch cheaks if the numbers on the left is less or equal the numbers in the right

## Logical Operators :
whitch alows you compare the results of more than 1 comparison operator

- ### Logical ***AND (`&&`)*** :
it tastes if the both evalute to **true** then the expression returns **true**
if just one of these it returns **false**

- ### Logical ***OR (`||`)*** :
it taset if either expression evaluates to **true** then the expression returns **true**
if the both is **flase** it returns **false**

- ### Logical ***NOT (`!`)*** :
it just takes a single boolean value and inverts it

# Loops :
its another kind of cheak conditions, if it returns **true** the code after will run, then it will recheak again if it is still return true and keep cheak and run until returns **flse**
and there is 3 typs of loops:
![cap](https://3madov-77.github.io/learning-journal/New%20folder/Capture-8-1b.PNG)

### 1. FOR : it is usually a counter which is used to tell how many times loop should run..

### 2. WHILE : you can use while if you dont know how many times the code will keep loop, it will keep loop until the condition is true and its like :

### 3. DO WHILE : its same of ehile loop but in difference: it will always run thr statments inside the curly braces at least once, even if the condation evaluates to false..

## Loops Counters :
when the loop used to counter for how many times it should repeat, so the counters loops must had 3 main sections:
1. **Initialization** : wich it basicly creating the varuble inside the loop

2. **Condition** : the loop should continue to run until the counter reaches specified number

![cap](https://3madov-77.github.io/learning-journal/New%20folder/Capture-8-3b.PNG)

3. **Update** : evrey time the has run the statment in the curly braces, it will adds the update to the varuble (it is usualy adds 1) like:

So simply looping be something like :
