## How to add Js to your HTML code :
as **CSS** there is difernet ways to link js to your code..
**1. The External Way (Linking):**
when we write the whole **JS** code in diferint file then link to it in the HTML code inside the tag `<script>` in the last body line before closing `</body>`

**2. The Internal Way (Placing):**
when you write the **JS** code inside the same HTML code ***Under*** the Tag `<script>`

**3. The Inline Way:**
when you write only the **JS** rules in the same element line, it mean that JS runs where its found..

## so how to use JS and objects :

> document.write("Heloo World!");

- **document**: the first part witch represint the page and its always exist in wep pages

- **.** : yes the dot! its the way to acsses the member of an abject

- **write()** : its method that is familer for `Document` opject, and it allows to add new content to the element

- **('the text here')** : or parametres as know to all, so its basicly represnts the information that **Method** need to, and it sometimes it be inside parentheses..


## What is statments ?
the step that computer folows to complete reading the `<script>`

> always remember that JS is sensitive for cases so `DOCUMENT` means something difrent than `document` 

## What comment means :
always use comments to describe what hapinig in the code so you dont get lost in some point..
and in Js comments looks like `//` in the start of the line, you can also add multi line comments by add `/*`at the begin and `*/` 

## WHAT IS A VARIABLE?
its kind of container for bits of information that JS needs, variables sometimes contain steps that you want script to rember like: var x = y*y +'this is the cube space' so evry time will mention `X` it will depends witch `y` is and use it had the cube space..
you can assign value to them like: `(the varuble name) = (the value)`, and there is ruls to name variable like:
1. The name must begin with a letter, dollar sign ($),or an underscore (_). It must not start with a number
2. The name can contain letters, numbers, dollar sign ($), or an underscore (_)
3. You cannot use keywords or reserved words
4. All variables are case sensitive, so score and Score would be different variable names
5. Use a name that describes the kind of information that the variable stores
6. If your variable name is made up of more than one word, use a capital letter for the first letter of every word after the first word
you can store diferint types of data in variables (String, Intger, or **BOOLEAN**)


## Witch data JS support :
JavaScript distinguishes between numbers, strings, true or false and even values and the three data types is:
***1. STRING DATA :*** it used when we worked on any kind of text, and it enclosed within singel or double quotes

***2. NUMERIC DATA :*** witch always used with tasks such as determining the size of the screen, moving the position of an element on a page or tasks that involve counting or calculating sums

***3. BOOLEAN DATA :*** witch simply only mention to tow answrs.. `True` OR `False`
